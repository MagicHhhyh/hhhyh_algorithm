Vladislav has a binary square grid of$n \times n$$$ cells. A triangle or a square is drawn on the grid with symbols$\texttt{1}$$$. As he is too busy being cool, he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  triangle

   

  is a shape consisting of$k$$$ ($$$k>1$$$) consecutive rows, where the$i$$$-th row has$2 \cdot i-1$$$ consecutive characters$\texttt{1}$$$, and the central

   

  1

  s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

  square

   

  is a shape consisting of$k$$$ ($$$k>1$$$) consecutive rows, where the$i$$$-th row has$k$$$ consecutive characters$\texttt{1}$$$, which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.





Input



The first line contains a single integer$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10$$$) — the size of the grid.

The next$n$$$ lines each contain$n$$$ characters$\texttt{0}$$$ or$\texttt{1}$$$.

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the$\texttt{1}$$$s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle or square is greater than$1$$$ (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).





Output



For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the$\texttt{1}$$$s in the grid form a square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).
